R functions to download and clean daily and intra-daily prices of stocks
and indices on Shanghai and Shenzhen markets.
The data are from Netease(http://money.163.com).
The names of functions are inspired by quantmod package.
I only tested in Ubuntu 14.04.

GetSymbols(HF).netease.R
    Download (intra-)daily prices of a symbol/code, then save to a file
    or load to the parent environment.
CleanSymbols(HF).netease.R
    Clean the downloaded prices.
GetAllSymbols(HF).R
    A script to automatically download and clean (intra-)daily prices
    of all symbols/codes.

EXAMPLE:

  - To download daily prices of Shanghai Composite Index, save to
    "SH000001.csv", and load to environment with name "SH000001", from
    the earliest record to today, the following codes are equivalent:
      GetSymbols.netease("0000001")
      GetSymbols.netease("000001", market="Shanghai")
      GetSymbols.netease("0000001", savefile="SH000001.csv",
                         dfname="SH000001")
  - To only load the data without saving to a file:
      GetSymbols.netease("0000001", savefile=NA)
  - To only save the data to a file without loading it:
      GetSymbols.netease("0000001", dfname=NA)
  - To keep the chinese column names:
      GetSymbols.netease("0000001", translate=FALSE)

  - To download intra-daily prices of Shanghai Composite Index of the
    day of 2015/11/02, save to "SH000001_20151102.xls":
      GetSymbols.netease("0000001", "20151102")
      GetSymbols.netease("0000001", "20151102",
                         savefile="SH000001_20151102.xls")

  - To clean the daily prices of file "SH000001.csv", then overwrite it:
      CleanSymbols.netease("SH000001.csv")
      CleanSymbols.netease("SH000001.csv", savefile="SH000001.csv")
  - To clean the daily prices of file "SH000001.csv", then save to
    RData, with data frame named as "SH000001":
      CleanSymbols.netease("SH000001.csv", savefile="SH000001.RData")
      CleanSymbols.netease("SH000001.csv", savefile="SH000001.RData",
                           dfname="SH000001")

  - To clean the intra-daily prices of file "SH000001_20151102.xls",
    then save it to an RData, with data frame named as "notsobigdata":
      CleanSymbolsHF.netease("SH000001_20151102.xls",
                             savefile="a_name_you_like.RData",
                             dfname="notsobigdata")
